Different ways for calculating the local time-step are available:

localTimeStep.C is the default computation for the maximum local time step and
is written especialy for unstructured meshes.

localTimeStep-minDeltaX.C uses the approach to calculate the maximum local
time-step based on the minimum perpendicular distance from the cell center to a
face center in each cell.

localTimeStep_volume-by-max-faceArea.C computes a characteristic length scale
due to divinding the cell volume by the maximum face area of this cell, which
gives a minimum length for this cell.

localTimeStep-DeltaCoeffs.C makes use of OpenFOAM's deltaCoefficients. Here the
time-step is based on the distance of the owner and neighbour cell centers.
This approach might me more efficient than the minDeltaX-approach, because the
deltaCoefficients are already available and don't have to be re-evaluated in
each iteration for moving meshes.

The first approaches has been sucessfully tested for a wide band of
applications. For the latter (localTimeStep-DeltaCoeffs.C) some additional
testings have to be performed and the viscous time-step has been dropped here.

To choose one of schemes, the contents of the .C and .H files have to be copied
into the localTimeStep.C and localTimeStep.H. Then the timeStepping library has
to be recompiled.
